<title>NixOps Release Notes</title>


<!--==================================================================-->

<section xml:id="ssec-relnotes-1.1.1"><title>Release 1.1.1 (October 1, 2013)</title>

<para>This a minor bugfix release.</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>Added a command-line option <emphasis>--include-keys</emphasis> to allow
  importing SSH public host keys, of the machines that will be imported, to the 
  <emphasis>.ssh/known_hosts</emphasis> of the user.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Fixed a bug that prevented switching the <emphasis>deployment.storeKeysOnMachine</emphasis>
  option value.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>On non-EC2 systems, nixops will generate ecdsa SSH host keypairs 
  in stead of dsa from now on.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>VirtualBox deployments use generated SSH host keypairs.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>For all machines which nixops generates an SSH host keypair for, it
  will add the SSH public host key to the known_hosts configuration of all machines
  in the network.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>For EC2 deployments, if the nixops expression specifies a set of
  security groups for a machine that is different from the security groups applied to
  the existing machine, it will produce a warning that the change cannot be made.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>For EC2 deployments, disks that are not supposed to be attached to the
  machine are detached only after system activation has been completed. Previously this
  was done before, but that could lead to volumes not being able to detach without
  needing to stop the machine.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Added a command-line option <emphasis>--repair</emphasis> as a convient
  way to pass this option, which allows repairing of broken or changed paths in the nix store,
  to nix-build calls that nixops performs. Note that this option only works in nix setups
  that run without the nix daemon.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The nixops executable now has the default OpenSSH from nixpkgs

    out for that machine.</para></listitem>
